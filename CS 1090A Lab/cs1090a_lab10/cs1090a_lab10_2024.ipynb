    "\"A Bagging regressor is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base regressors each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important arguments are `estimator` which defines the base estimators from which the bagged ensemble is composed and well as `n_estimators`, the number of estimators in the ensemble.\n",

    "We always choose to split on the feature with the most impact: i.e., the most information gain.\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\bullet$ Finding the optimal decision trees is an NP-complete problem, so in practice this is infeasible.\n",
